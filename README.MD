# VS Code Dev Container Base Template

**A simple [VS Code Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) with Node.js, Python, and Zsh.**

This template creates a containerized development environment that includes both Node.js and Python runtimes, along with a configured Zsh shell. It's designed as a starting point for projects that need these languages in a consistent, reproducible environment.

-   [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with [Dev Containers](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) extension

## Setup

### Getting started

#### For new projects:

1. Click 'Use this template' on this GitHub repository
2. Follow instructions to create your new repository

#### Existing project

1. Download the zipped repository to your local machine
2. Extract to your project root

### Font Installation

**Note: If you already have the MesloLGS NF fonts installed on your local machine, just do step 2.**

1. Install the MesloLGS NF fonts from `.devcontainer/fonts/`:

    - **macOS**: Double-click each `.ttf` file and click "Install"
    - **Windows**: Right-click each `.ttf` file and select "Install"
    - **Linux**: Copy to `/usr/share/fonts/truetype/` and run `fc-cache -fv`

2. (Optional, but recommended): Delete the `.devcontainer/fonts/` directory

#### Q: Why are these fonts needed?

We've configured the Dev Container's integrated terminal to use MesloLGS NF as the font family (which is [Powerlevel10k's recommended font](https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k?tab=readme-ov-file#fonts)). VS Code can only use fonts on your local machineâ€”so, we've got to install MesloLGS NF locally.

You can alter the font family in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. If you do, you should run the `p10k configure` command in a Zsh instance (in your Dev Container) to re-set up Powerlevel10k's theme. Then rewrite the `.devcontainer/shell-config/p10k.zsh` with the new Powerlevel10k configuration (found at `/root/.p10k.zsh` in the container), so that your changes persist across container rebuilds.

### Running the Dev Container

1. Fire up your project in VS Code (make sure the `.devcontainer` folder is at the root)
2. Open the Command Palette
3. Select `Dev Containers: Reopen in Container`

VS Code will build the container image and start the Dev Container.

### Shutting Down the Dev Container

You can simply close the VS Code window. This will automatically stop the container process (you can check check active containers via `podman ps` or `docker ps`).

Or you can reload your project on your local machine:

1. Open the Command Palette
2. Select `Dev Containers: Reopen Folder Locally`

## Usage

### Node.js

By default, the latest LTS version of Node.js is installed by nvm. You can configure this by changing the NVM_VERSION arg in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. You can read more about using nvm in the [nvm documentation](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#readme). The `node` alias is available in the terminal.

### Python

By default, the latest stable version of Python is installed by uv. You can configure this by modifying the `PYTHON_VERSIONS` in the `args` object in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`. Note that you can install multiple Python versions by separating each version by a space: (ex: `"PYTHON_VERSIONS": "3.9 3.10 3.13"`).

While nvm adds `node` directly to your PATH, uv uses a different approach in which Python runs through the `uv` command. Read more about using uv in the [uv documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

### Terminal

Zsh loads automatically with all enhancements active.

## Customization

### Container Configuration

Edit the following files to customize the Dev Container to your specific needs:

-   `.devcontainer/Containerfile` - Add/remove packages or modify the container image

-   `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` - Configure VS Code extensions and settings

### Shell Configuration

-   `.devcontainer/shell-config/.zshrc` - Customize Zsh behavior

-   `.devcontainer/shell-config/p10k.zsh` - Configure Powerlevel10k theme

## Troubleshooting

**The Dev Container is super slow**: Check [VS Code's performance optimization guide](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/improve-performance) -- This is particularly felt on Windows machines.

**Use with Podman**: Set `"dev.containers.dockerPath": "podman"` in your local machine's VS Code user settings ([official docs](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/docker-options#_podman))

**Container won't start**: Verify that your containerization platform (Podman/Docker) is running

**VS Code integrated terminal font looks wrong**: Ensure MesloLGS NF font family is installed on your local machine
